Dork
====

DOT to PNG as a service.

Run the server: `bin/dorkd`
Use the service: `cat /path/to/graph.dot | bin/dork > graph.png`

At the moment you'll need to install dot and run a Stomp server on your
machine which makes the whole thing a little pointless, but there's no reason
this couldn't be hosted somewhere else and you just use the client on your
machine.
